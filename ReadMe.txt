This React repo represents my MERN (MongoDb Express React Node) assignments completed 
during my time enrolled in Coding Dojo's MERN course. This MERN course is 1 of 3 
programming languages included in Coding Dojo's "Full-Stack" course curriculum 
(Python, Java & React <aka MERN>). I've completed all 3 courses for the 3 programming 
languages in the Full-Stack.

The name of this repo (& most of its folders) and its general folder structure was 
determined by the course. The MERN classwork is split into 4 sub-folders 
which flows in this order: 1)JavaScript 2)React 3) Express 4) MongoDb
